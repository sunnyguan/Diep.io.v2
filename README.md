# Diep.io.v2
My humble attempt at coding diep.io using NodeJS and a lot of fancy (and probably unnecessary) JS tricks.
Demo: https://dapaoninja.herokuapp.com

How to run locally:
1. Install NodeJS and NPM
2. Run npm start
3. Go to localhost:2000 in your favorite browser
4. Enjoy and try to ignore a few UI and collision bugs

Improvements:
- Separate big files into smaller classes
- Fix UI bugs
- Fix bullet collision
- Lower package size

All credits to Diep.io for inspring this project.
