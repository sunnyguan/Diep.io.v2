# Diep.io.v2
My humble attempt at coding diep.io using NodeJS and a lot of fancy (and probably unnecessary) JS tricks.
Demo: https://dapaoninja.herokuapp.com

Features:
1. Basic functionality
2. Upgrade paths (currently in debug mode, squares are 1.5k points to upgrade faster)
3. Shapes (spinning, exploding animation)
4. Movement speed up and slow down
5. Slight antialiasing
6. Upgrade points uses Siriwave.js
7. Network optimization (smoothing between server packets)
8. Any bugs you find

How to run locally:
1. Install NodeJS and NPM
2. Run npm start
3. Go to localhost:2000 in your favorite browser
4. Enjoy and try to ignore a few UI and collision bugs

Improvements:
- Separate big files into smaller classes
- Fix UI bugs
- Fix bullet collision
- Lower package size
